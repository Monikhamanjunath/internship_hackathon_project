###  Problem Being Solved

Legal documents are long, full of jargon, and often confusing. Many individuals or startups donâ€™t have access to lawyers for every contract they sign. Manually reading and understanding clauses (like Termination, Indemnity, Governing Law, etc.) is time-consuming and risky.

**JuriScan automates the review process** using NLP and legal clause logic. It detects risky patterns, flags missing clauses, and provides meaningful summaries and translations â€” making legal documents easy to understand and safer to use.
